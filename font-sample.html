      <em>
        Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; Where
        <br>knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
        <br>by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth;
        <br>Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the
        <br>clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand
        of dead habit</em
